## Project Structure

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Libraries**: Axios/Fetch API, React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
- **State Management**: React state or external state management libraries

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap, Axios, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Render, Heroku
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handling middleware

## Features

### Task 1: Frontend Development
- **Recipe Listing**: View a list of recipes filtered by ingredients or cuisine type.
- **Recipe Detail View**: Detailed view of a recipe, including title, ingredients, cooking instructions, and more.
- **Forms for CRUD Operations**: Create forms for adding new recipes and editing existing ones.
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI styled with Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
- **State Management**: Managed using React hooks or an external library for better state handling.

### Task 2: Backend Development
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **User Authentication**: Sign-up and login functionality using JWT.
  - **Recipe CRUD Operations**:
    - `POST`: Create a new recipe.
    - `GET`: Retrieve all recipes or a specific recipe by ID.
    - `PUT`: Update an existing recipe.
    - `DELETE`: Remove a recipe from the database.
- **Database Schema**: Designed with appropriate fields for recipes, including timestamps and user references.
- **Error Handling**: Custom middleware to manage errors effectively.

### Task 3: Full-Stack Integration
- **Integration**: Connect the React frontend with the Node.js backend using Axios or Fetch API.
- **Deployment**:
  - **Frontend**: Deployed to Vercel or Netlify.
  - **Backend**: Deployed to Heroku or Render.
- **Testing**: Ensured all application features work seamlessly, including authentication and CRUD operations.
- **Documentation**: Updated README detailing the CSV import/export functionality.

## Deployment

### Instructions for Deployment
1. **Ensure your GitHub repository is public**.
2. **Deploy the frontend**:
   - Use Vercel or Netlify and link it with your GitHub repository.
3. **Deploy the backend**:
   - Use Heroku or Render to deploy your backend API.
4. **Update your README**:
   - Add the live URLs for both the frontend and backend to the `README`.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB running locally or using MongoDB Atlas.

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Setup the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Setup the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with necessary configurations (e.g., database connection URL, JWT secret).

## Instructions for Testing

1. **Run both frontend and backend servers locally**.
2. **Test all CRUD operations**:
   - Ensure you can create, read, update, and delete recipes.
   - Test user authentication and login functionality.
3. **Check CSV import/export**:
   - Verify that CSV import/export works as expected.
4. **Submit a comprehensive report** with detailed steps for running the project and testing functionalities.
